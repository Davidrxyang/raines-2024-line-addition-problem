         * as well as the newly generated line. Since pathplanning
         * uses the stations lines, it is trying to access old WMATA 
         * connections, which are now null in the connections collection
         * in the new network. 
         * 
         * fix:
         * remove old lines from each station when adding new lines
         * 
         * or reallocated new stations??
